I would like to include a rounds function, like best out of 5 games and I would like the game to reset after a draw or winner. 

I would also like to change the colors and style of the game.

I would implement these by creating a function that keeps track of games and the winner so a tally can be made, it would also include a next round button that will repopulate the board without resetting the child info so it keeps track of the winners without erasing that info.
